                        Investors should be aware there are risks to investing in securities of any company, especially if they are private companies not listed on a Recognised Investment Exchange, and there may be little or no opportunity to sell the securities easily should you need to do so. The value of your Investments can go down as well as up and therefore you may lose some, or in extreme cases, all of the value of your initial investment. Risk warning

                    <p>
